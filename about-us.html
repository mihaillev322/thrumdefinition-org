<h1>About Thrum Definition and our approach to textile terms</h1>
<section id="mission">
<h2>Our mission: accurate definitions for textile work</h2>
<p>Thrum Definition serves students, weavers, manufacturing teams, and researchers who need clear, accurate explanations of textile terminology without commercial bias or regional limitations. Our audience includes textile engineering students learning fundamental concepts, craft weavers seeking to understand industrial processes, manufacturing professionals training new staff, and researchers requiring precise definitions for academic work.</p>
<p>We maintain an international scope by using British English spelling and avoiding region-specific trade names or practices that don't translate across different textile markets. This approach ensures our definitions remain useful whether you're working in European mills, Asian manufacturing centres, or North American craft studios.</p>
<p>Our content connects practical definitions with process context, helping readers understand not just what terms mean, but how they fit into broader textile production systems. Visit our <a href="/">main thrum definition page</a> to see this approach in action, or explore our <a href="/faq">comprehensive FAQ section</a> for detailed applications and examples.</p>
</section>
<section id="method">
<h2>How we write: terminology, context, and verification</h2>
<p>We distinguish carefully between factual definitions and subjective opinions, focusing on established terminology that appears consistently across authoritative textile sources. Our definitions describe what terms mean and how processes work, rather than advocating for particular methods or suppliers. This neutral approach helps readers understand concepts without being influenced by commercial interests or personal preferences.</p>
<p>Source selection emphasises authority, stability, and clarity, drawing primarily from established encyclopaedias, academic institutions, government agencies, and recognised industry organisations. We avoid sources that change frequently, contain advertising, or represent single viewpoints rather than established consensus. This careful curation ensures our definitions reflect widely accepted understanding rather than niche interpretations.</p>
<p>For comprehensive textile terminology, we recommend the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000508.shtml">Library of Congress textile format documentation</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_textile_manufacturing">Wikipedia glossary of textile manufacturing</a>, both of which provide extensive context for understanding thrum definition within broader textile systems.</p>

<h2>Contact and feedback</h2>
<p>We welcome corrections, suggestions, and questions about textile terminology through our email address: <a href="mailto:info@thrumdefinition.org">info@thrumdefinition.org</a>. When writing, please include the specific term or concept you're addressing, the context where you encountered it, and any authoritative sources that support your feedback. This information helps us evaluate suggestions effectively and maintain our editorial standards.</p>
<p>Feedback about missing terms, unclear explanations, or outdated information helps us improve our coverage and accuracy. We particularly value input from textile professionals, educators, and researchers who can provide industry context and identify gaps in our current content. All correspondence receives careful consideration, though we may not be able to respond individually to every message.</p>
<p>For quick answers to common questions about thrum applications, recycling options, and quality considerations, visit our <a href="/faq">FAQ section</a> which addresses the most frequent enquiries we receive about textile terminology and processes.</p>
